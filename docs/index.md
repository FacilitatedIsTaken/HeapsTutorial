# Introduction
Welcome to this tutorial on using Heaps in game development. Heaps is a powerful game framework created by Nicolas Cannasse for the Haxe programming language. In this tutorial, we will cover all the necessary steps to start developing games with Heaps.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using Heaps, you need to have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Haxe compiler (version 4 or later, Nightly build works also)

- Heaps framework (latest version)

- A code editor or integrated development environment (IDE)

If you don't have these prerequisites installed, we recommend you to follow Deepnight's [tutorial](https://deepnight.net/tutorial/a-quick-guide-to-installing-haxe/) on installing Haxe to get started.

## Target Audience
This tutorial is designed for beginners who are interested in game development and have little programming experience. We will cover the basics of Haxe programming language as well as Heaps.

## Overview
In this tutorial, we will start with the basics of Haxe programming language and gradually move towards more advanced topics. We will cover the following topics:

- Graphics and Rendering
- Input and Audio
- Physics and Collision Detection
- Use of Sprites and Spritesheets
- Advanced Game Development Concepts

Throughout the tutorial, we will provide examples and exercises to help you understand the concepts better. We will also provide links to the official Heaps documentation for further reference.
